<p>When Apple announced they were refreshing the Macbook Pro, it was pretty much fate accompli that I would upgrade. But then the announcement happened.</p>

<p>And I was super freaking bummed. I understand some folks were toked about the LED bar of usefulness, but I was not. So, for the second time in my life, I found myself switching operating systems. I switched in about 2004 to OS X, and this would be a huge emotional change for me. I was a PC up until then.</p>

<p>So now, I am an Ubuntu Box. Almost--<strong>The Journey</strong> is long, young padawan.</p>

<p>OK, so it's freak-out time. And I'm even lucky enough that I have been using various flavors of linux for over a decade--from Ubuntu to SUSE to Redhat to Fedora. Pretty much everything except raw Debian, or raw Arch, I had tried at one point or another.</p>

<p>I used a little i5 I had hanging around to try out some of the "made for consumer" desktop environments. Apricity, Kubuntu, ElementaryOS. They are super-cool looking, especially Apricity in my opinion.</p>

<p>Many people call them "unstable" because they are immature. There are arguments online about this, but in the end, I found them to be stable once I got them working--they are just simply immature and constraining. If my work in AI allowed me to go deeper into Arch, I would have chosen Apricity--it's beautiful and well thought-through, customizable and powerful. The challenge is that the best support for GPU-based, nVidia deep-learning is on Ubuntu. So Ubuntu it is.</p>

<a id="freaking-out-about-apps" class="anchor" href="#freaking-out-about-apps" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Freaking out about apps</h3>

<p>I have all 8 years of my kids lives documented and stored in OS X Photos. I use a lot of OS X apps such as Pixelmator, Movie, etc.</p>

<p>I did some research, and it appears to be possible to run OS X in a virtual machine. There are some legal questions about this, but given that I will have a Mac, <em>NOT</em> running OS X just sitting next to this laptop, I went with it.</p>

<h3>
<a id="picking-hardware" class="anchor" href="#picking-hardware" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Picking Hardware</h3>

<p>I chose an MSI GS63VR. I configured it at XoticPC because they were willing to install the memory and HD upgrade I wanted--I wanted 4k, a super-fast PCIe NVME SSD Drive, 32 GB RAM, and a 2TB physical disk to make up for the slightly smaller SSD.</p>

<p>The box arrived and it is a beautiful machine, so now the ridiculousness begins.</p>
